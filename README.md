# Open

> *Designed for desktop browsers.*

[*Open*](https://stereo-images.github.io/open/) began with the sound of cathedral bells drifting through an open window. The sound belonged in that room, and I felt its absence when I moved. That memory became the wellspring for this piece.

Instead of recording bells, I went in the opposite direction: a “window” that’s blank on purpose: a browser window. No particular scene, no particular place, just a clean space for sound to travel through. This music is my way of experiencing what can come through that digital window, and what I can build inside it.

The page makes low, synthetic bell tones. They are tuned to a clear musical grid, yet their internal harmonics are chaotic, creating a tension between the stability of the melody and the ambiguity of the bell itself. Each time it runs, it creates a different sequence of sounds. They are quiet and move slowly, drifting slightly over time so that nothing ever repeats exactly. Notes appear, fade out, and leave space.

The pacing is slow. The sounds do not ask for your attention. Rather, they sit alongside and hopefully enhance whatever else is happening: the light in your room, the noise outside, or the work you're doing.

*Open* is meant to run quietly in the background with minimal fuss: no logins and no accounts—only the last tone/duration may be remembered locally. You can change the tone or the duration. Each run is temporary, and when the sound stops, it’s gone.

### "Infinite" Mode and Structure
When set to "Infinite", the piece creates a non-repeating journey using specific harmonic logic:

* **Circle of Fifths:** The system navigates through related keys (e.g., C Major → G Major → E Minor), creating a procession through different harmonic colors.
* **Contour:** The melody is not random; it uses a constrained random walk. A "gravity" system pulls notes toward a central register, preventing the melody from drifting too high or too low while ensuring no two phrases are identical.
* **Tension:** As the harmony moves away from the root, the bell timbre becomes brighter and the intervals more complex. When it resolves, the tone returns to a simpler, duller hum.

### Technical Architecture
*Open* is built on the standard Web Audio API without external libraries. The engine uses a custom "Gatekeeper" logic to solve the mud problem common in web audio.

* **Smart Drones (The Gatekeeper):** To prevent dissonance, the drone system analyzes tension and melody in real-time. It forces the drone to collapse into a neutral "Open Fifth" when the melody is complex, and only allows the warm "Third" interval to bloom when the harmony is stable.
* **Synthesis (True Drift):** Notes are generated by FM oscillator pairs. To replicate the imperfections of cast metal, each note triggers a cluster of voices with randomized ratios. No two notes ever have the exact same timbre.
* **Physics:** The engine models physical decay by reducing the Modulation Index (brightness) faster than the Amplitude (volume). The sound starts bright and fades into a pure sine wave.
* **Ghost Downbeat:** The internal logic clock starts before the audio engine does. This eliminates the "start button" feeling; the music doesn't begin, it drifts in as if it were already playing.
* **Acoustics:**
    * **Impulse Response:** A custom convolution reverb with a 10-second tail and 2.8s decay.
    * **Pre-Delay (45ms):** A gap between the dry sound and the reverb to simulate distance.
    * **Filter (4200Hz):** The reverb return is low-passed to remove digital harshness while keeping the upper harmonics.

### Usage
1. **Launch:** Click "Play" to start the generative engine.
2. **Tone:** Use the slider to set the fundamental frequency (Safety floor: 100Hz).
3. **Duration:** Select a fixed time (1m, 5m, 10m, 30m) or Infinite.

### Output and Saving
Because there are no project files, you save the *audio*, not the *session*.
* **Live Recording:** Press **`R`** (or click Record) to capture the audio stream exactly as you hear it. Saves as a `.webm` file.
