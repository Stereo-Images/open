# Open

> *Designed for desktop browsers.*

[*Open*](https://stereo-images.github.io/open/) began with the sound of cathedral bells drifting through an open window. The sound belonged in that room, and I felt its absence when I moved. That memory became the wellspring for this piece.

Instead of recording bells, I went in the opposite direction: a browser window. No particular scene, no particular place, just a sparse frame for sound to travel through. This music is my way of exploring what can come through that digital window, and what I can build inside it.

The piece makes low, synthetic bell tones. While they’re tuned to a clear set of notes, their internal harmonics are messy, creating tension between a steady melody and an ambiguous bell. Every time it runs, it creates a different sequence of sounds. They are quiet, move slowly, and do not repeat exactly. Notes appear, fade out, and leave space.

The sounds do not ask for your attention. They sit alongside and maybe enhance whatever else is happening: the light in your room, the noise outside, or the work you're doing.

*Open* is meant to run quietly in the background with minimal fuss: no logins and no saved settings. You can change the tone or the duration. Each run is temporary, and when the sound stops, it’s gone.

### "Infinite" Mode and Structure
When set to "Infinite," the piece creates a non-repeating journey using specific harmonic logic:

* **Circle of Fifths:** Slowly moves by fifths through closely related keys, with intermittent toggles into the relative minor.
* **Contour:** The melody is not random; it uses a constrained random walk. A "gravity" system pulls notes toward a central register, preventing the melody from drifting too high or too low while ensuring no two phrases are identical.
* **Tension:** As the harmony moves away from the root, the bell timbre becomes brighter and the intervals more complex. When it resolves, the tone returns to a simpler, duller hum.

### Technical Architecture
*Open* is built on the standard Web Audio API without external libraries. The engine features specific acoustic modeling to achieve the physical weight of the sound.

* **Synthesis:** Notes are generated by FM oscillator pairs. Like the imperfections of cast metal, each note triggers a cluster of 2 to 3 voices with inharmonic ratios.
* **Physics:** The engine models physical decay by reducing the Modulation Index (brightness) faster than the Amplitude (volume). The sound starts bright and fades into a pure sine wave.
* **Acoustics:**
    * **Impulse Response:** A custom convolution reverb with a 10-second tail and 2.8s decay.
    * **Pre-Delay (45ms):** A gap between the dry sound and the reverb to simulate distance.
    * **Filter (4200Hz):** The reverb return is low-passed to remove digital harshness while keeping the upper harmonics.
* **Dynamics:** During dense sections, the reverb level is managed to prevent muddying. Before structural peaks, the reverb briefly cuts out (the "Shadow" state) and swells back in to create spatial movement.

### Usage
1. **Launch:** Click "Open" to start the audio.
2. **Tone:** Use the slider to set the fundamental frequency (Safety floor: 55Hz).
3. **Duration:** Select a fixed time (1m, 5m, 30m) or Infinite.
4. **Record:** Press 'R' or click Record to save a live `.webm` file of the current session.
